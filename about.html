<p>Hey, because this is my homepage, I should introduce myself. Let me try to gauge your perception of myself based on my self-description. I'm hoping that your opinion of myself and mine don't diverge too much. This is it.</p>

<p>I'm a person who sees the bright side of everything. I like a wide variety of activities, sights, and experiences. I enjoy talking and listening as well as reading and writing. I enjoy dreaming and reflecting on ideas. I enjoy seeing the sunrise in the morning and the moonlight at night. I enjoy staring blankly up at the clouds in the sky. I enjoy going to bed early and waking up late; I enjoy being by myself as well as being surrounded by others.</p>

<p>I've always aspired to be a brilliant scientist, just like Einstein, who coined the "Theory of Relativity," or like Newton, who established science on the basis of a wager. They have had an impact on all of humankind. Of course, I'm still a long way away from these individuals. I'm simply a person who performs some research, teaching, and coding. But my dream endures.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I'll give you a quick rundown of who I am. Reading my articles or looking at my photos will help you learn more if you're curious. Maintain your sense of humor and do not have unrealistic expectations.</p>
